To generate .csv file with predictions run the script 'run.py' (detailed instruction below). All functions required to execute the script are in 'implementations.py' file and provided helpers files ('costs.py', ' helpers.py', proj1_helpers.py'.

Basic methods implementations are included in 'implementations.py' file.

**NOTE: all main methods are in implementations.py**

How does 'run.py' script work?
Script execution consist of 5 parts:
1.Loading data for training and testing from .csv files - must be included in the same folder as script with names 'train.csv', 'test.csv'
2.Preparing data (as described in report)
3.Computing weights using regularized logistic regression with k-fold cross validation to select an appropriate lambda parameter
4.Generating predictions
5.Saving .csv file with predictions - output file can be found in the same folder as script with name 'submission.csv'
6.Scripts have the convention that data sets are located in the parent directory of its folder
7.Plot generation as displayed in the report can be found at plot_generation.py
8.Some code depends on specific dataset generation (plot_generation.py) in specific, it won't work unless train/test_sel.py are first generated.
